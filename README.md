# Yokoi Blocks

Yokoi is a modular Gutenberg block suite for WordPress featuring site-wide settings managed from a dedicated PluginSidebar panel. The roadmap follows modern WordPress development practices, including per-block asset loading, REST-powered configuration, and scalable PHP architecture inspired by Kadence Blocks.

## Development Setup

1. Install PHP dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```
2. Install Node dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development build:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Build production assets:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Directory Layout

- `yokoi.php` – Plugin bootstrap
- `includes/` – PHP classes for registration, REST API, asset loading
- `src/` – JavaScript/SCSS sources for blocks and the PluginSidebar
- `build/` – Compiled assets generated by `@wordpress/scripts`
- `languages/` – Translation files

## Coding Standards

- PHP: WordPress Coding Standards via PHPCS (`vendor/bin/phpcs`)
- JavaScript/SCSS: `@wordpress/scripts` linting (`npm run lint:js`, `npm run lint:css`)
- Pre-commit automation: Husky + lint-staged
